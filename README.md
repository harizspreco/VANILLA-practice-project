# Test Project

This project, created with Vanilla JS, CSS, HTML, and my first venture into using IndexedDB, serves as a testament to my commitment to hands-on learning. It was a personal challenge where I deliberately refrained from relying on external packages or modules, opting to build everything from scratch.

## Project Overview

The primary goal was to assess and expand my knowledge in core web technologies. Despite the project not achieving perfection, it represents a valuable learning experience. The decision to utilize IndexedDB for the first time added an extra layer of complexity, allowing me to delve into data persistence within the browser.

## Key Learnings

- **Vanilla JS:** Embracing the power and intricacies of JavaScript without external libraries or frameworks provided a deep understanding of its capabilities.
  
- **CSS Styling:** Crafting styles from the ground up improved my proficiency in CSS, reinforcing the importance of responsive and visually appealing designs.

- **HTML Structure:** Focusing on clean and semantic HTML structures contributed to a better grasp of document semantics and accessibility practices.

- **Introduction to IndexedDB:** Exploring IndexedDB for local data storage broadened my understanding of client-side databases and their integration into web applications.

## Conclusion

While the project may not be flawless, its imperfections mark the journey of learning and growth. I share this repository to showcase the progress made and the lessons learned during this self-imposed challenge.
